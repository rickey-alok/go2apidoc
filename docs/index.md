When we talk about the API documentation, we often hear the term `Docs-as-Code` approach. This approach involves creating documentation using the same tools and processes that developers use for coding. So, to be in the shoes of a developers, you must familiarize yourself with the topics below:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A versatile code editor that developers love
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and collaborative development
